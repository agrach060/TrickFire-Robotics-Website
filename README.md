# Getting started

It is recommended to use **Visual Studio Code** as your text editor

1. After installing VS Code, download the Live Sass Complier extension [(Tutorial 0:26-1:35)](https://youtu.be/ms6ca5w3Qjk?t=26)

1. In VS Code, open the command palette (Ctrl-Shift-P) and type "Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)"

1. Paste this in your JSON file:

```JSON
{
    "liveSassCompile.settings.formats": [
        {
            "format": "expanded",
            "savePath": "/assets/css"
        }
    ],
    "liveSassCompile.settings.generateMap": false,
    "liveServer.settings.donotShowInfoMsg": true,
}
```

# Q&A

### What if I just want to suggest changes to the text/images on the website?

> Contact the current maintainers about the changes. If you want to do it anonymously, use this [form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=W9229i_wGkSZoBYqxQYL0l2s9_fTgfJAq7u6aZSNf2pUREZIMk1QRExVWVJMTVFMTFM0R1IxRTJOWC4u)

### Who owns/has access to the domain?

> Currently Michael V, a past member owns it but eventually will migrate to the team. However, it doesn't look like @uw.edu emails can own google domains, so Adam C and Vlad K currently have access to the Google Domain with their personal emails.

### Who pays for the domain?

> Michael V paid until around April and the team probably will need to pay the $24 per year for both domains going forward
