Although the fundamental design is the same as Grimlockâ€™s, the team completely overhaled the rover by adding in a reinforced carbon fiber frame, sailcloth dumping bin, and redesigning the drivetrain suspension.As a result, Atlas, with its light carbon fiber frame, now weighs in at 67 kilograms, a significant reduction to prior iterations.",

Grimlock boasted a fully dynamic digging arm with four degrees of freedom, similar to a classic excavator, with a dump truck style bin that was used to transport the mined regolith, and tank treads that can drive over any obstacle that could be thrown at it. With an all-aluminum chassis Grimlock weighed in at just shy of 80 kilograms.",
